# Part 1: Understanding Cloud Concepts

## What is the Cloud?

In computing, "the cloud" refers to a network of servers that are hosted on the internet rather than on a local server or personal computer. These servers are typically owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.

### Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing:

1. **On-Demand Service:** Users can access computing resources (such as storage, processing power, and applications) on-demand and pay only for what they use, typically on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.

2. **Scalability/Elasicity:** Cloud computing allows users to scale resources up or down easily based on their needs. This flexibility enables businesses to handle varying workloads without investing in additional hardware.

3. **Resource Pooling:** Cloud providers pool computing resources to serve multiple customers simultaneously. This efficiency allows for cost savings and optimal resource utilization.

4. **Broad Network Access:** Cloud services are accessible over the internet from anywhere, using a variety of devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, tablets), enabling remote access and collaboration.

5. **Measured Service:** Cloud computing resources are monitored, controlled, and reported transparently. Users can track their usage, performance, and costs, providing transparency and accountability.

### Types of Cloud Services:

Cloud computing offers various types of services, categorized into three main models:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. Users have control over operating systems, applications, and development frameworks.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. PaaS providers manage the infrastructure, including hardware and operating systems.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. SaaS applications run on cloud infrastructure and are accessible through a web browser, eliminating the need for users to install and maintain software locally.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing:

- **Cost Efficiency:** Eliminates upfront investment in hardware and reduces IT maintenance costs.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down to accommodate changing business needs.
- **Flexibility and Accessibility:** Enables remote access to applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection.
- **Reliability and Disaster Recovery:** Cloud providers offer redundant systems and backups to ensure data availability and minimize downtime.
- **Security:** Cloud providers implement robust security measures to protect data and comply with industry regulations.

In essence, cloud computing revolutionizes the way organizations and individuals access, store, process, and manage data and applications, offering flexibility, efficiency, and innovation in computing services.

## Cloud Computing Ecosystems

- **Consumers of Services**: Typical day-to-day users, with little understanding of how the cloud service is build or designed. Their focus is just using it to complete tasks. ie., OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud etc.

- **Providers of Services**: Providing cloud services, infrastructure, applications and tools. ie., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle, Alibaba.

- **Designer of Services**: Builders of the tools, designed for a specific cloud system or can augment a packaged cloud application. ie., Accenture, Deloitte, Capgemini, IBM, PricewaterhouseCooper(PwC), Cognizant, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services(TCS), Infosysy, DXC Technology.

### Cloud Concepts

_Cloud computing is_ is a method of providing shared computing resources, including applications, computing, storage, networking, development, and deployment platforms as well as business processes. Cloud computing makes computing resources easier to use by providing standardization and automation.

_Standardization_ is the implementation of services using a consistent approach supported by a set of consistent interfaces. Likewise, the cloud generally requires that processes be implemented through the use of automation.

_Automation_ is a process that’s triggered based on business rules, resource availability, and security demands. Automation is required to support a self-service provisioning model. To promote efficiency, automation can ensure that after a provisioned service is no longer needed, it is returned to the resource pool. This type of rules-based automation can help with capacity planning and overall workload management.

## Cloud Deployment Models

### Cloud Components and Clients
1. Client device/platform, where the services are being accessed.
2. Data center, where services are hosted.
3. The Network connection the first two components.

### Types of Cloud Computing
There are two deployement models to managing cloud service infrastructure, and a third being a combination of the two:

**Public cloud**:  A CSP owns the cloud deployment and allocates its resources to external, unaffiliated customers. Those customers share the public cloud’s resources without knowing precisely where their data is in relation to that of any other organization.
**Private cloud**:  Services are provided to only a single organization.
**Hybrid cloud**:  There is a combination of two or more private, public, or community deployments.
_Multicloud_ is the use of a variety of piublic cloud services, to support different business units/functions. This then referred to a multicloud environment. It allows developers to access the platform of their choice with ease, and the business has that flexibility to move between vendors.
